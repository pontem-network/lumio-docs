# Learn Move

Having deployed a contract on the Move VM and witnessed its simplicity, we recommend exploring the following resources to deepen your understanding of Move:

* [Aptos Move Book](https://aptos.dev/move/book/summary/): An essential resource for learning about Aptos Move. It covers everything from basic concepts to advanced topics.
* [Move Book](https://move-book.com/): A good starting point, although slightly outdated. It still provides a comprehensive overview of the syntax, design principles, and more.
* [Awesome Move](https://github.com/MystenLabs/awesome-move): A compilation of links to various projects, examples, and tutorials. It serves as an excellent entry point for exploring the Move ecosystem.
* [Pontem Official Documentation](https://docs.pontem.network/00.-about-pontem/about): Highly useful, offering examples and links to additional resources, aiding in both learning and application.
* [IntelliJ Tutorial](https://docs.pontem.network/02.-move-language/intellij\_ide\_extension): Ideal for those who prefer using PyCharm with the IntelliJ plugin. It demonstrates the plugin's utility and time-saving features.
* [Pontem Playground](https://playground.pontem.network/): Allows you to write contracts directly in your browser. Though it's based on the Aptos default framework, it's perfect for beginners.
