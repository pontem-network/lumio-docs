# Ecosystem

The network uniquely enables the simultaneous deployment of projects on both the EVM and Move VM. This dual compatibility allows developers to seamlessly migrate their projects from EVM-based ecosystems such as Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Avalanche, as well as from Aptos-based projects like Liquidswap and others.

## Liquidswap

The Pontem Network's Liquidswap DEX stands as the most prominent exchange protocol on the Aptos network, commanding over 50% of the total trading volume. To experience its capabilities firsthand, explore Liquidswap on the L2.

One of the most popular Aptos wallets offers native support for the L2, enabling seamless access to both the EVM and Move VM from a single wallet. This integration enhances the user experience by providing a smooth and unified interface.

**Important:** Please note that L2 support is currently available exclusively in the desktop version (browser extension) of the wallet.
