# Fault Proofs

The Fault Proofs system, akin to Optimism, is currently in a developmental stage where the challenge mechanism for Layer 2 (L2) is inactive, due to the disabling of fraud proofs games. However, a key feature of our system is its compatibility with the [MIPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIPS\_architecture) architecture, as used by [Cannon](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/develop/cannon). We have successfully compiled the Move VM to MIPS using the `no_std` library.

Our immediate focus is on integrating fraud proofs into the testnet. This will enhance the system's reliability and security, aligning it more closely with the functionality of Optimism. For those interested in a deeper understanding of the Fault Proof system within the Optimism (OP) stack, we recommend reviewing the [Optimism specifications](https://community.optimism.io/docs/protocol/).
