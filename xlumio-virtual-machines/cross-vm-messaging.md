# Cross-VM messaging

The Lumio framework facilitates calls between different Virtual Machines (VMs) â€” specifically between Move VM and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This is achieved through specialized smart contracts/modules, which are integral parts of the framework. For Move VM, these are implemented as part of the framework, while for EVM, they are core smart contracts and are deployed at genesis.

**Functionality:**

At a high level, both contracts, implemented on each VM, serve a similar purpose. They emit an "event" containing the call data and the sender's information, which is then executed on the target VM.

1. **Move VM Implementation**:&#x20;
   1. Implemented as a native function to streamline the serialization process.
   2. Data is passed as objects, and serialization/deserialization is managed.

**Restriction on Sender Accounts:**

Please be aware that the current version of our implementation does not support the use of Aptos resource accounts as senders. This is a temporary limitation that we are actively working to address.

### Move VM

The `evm.move` module within the Lumio framework, deployed as part of the Move VM, introduces specific enhancements for EVM integration and cross-VM communication capabilities:

```java
/// EVM Communication Module
/// This module enables the execution of smart contracts within the EVM-compatible layer of the Layer 2 (L2) infrastructure.
/// Designed as a key component of our L2 solution, this module facilitates seamless interaction with the EVM ecosystem.
/// It acts as a bridge, allowing users and other smart contracts to initiate and execute smart contract functions
/// that reside on the EVM side of the L2 platform. This integration ensures compatibility and extends
/// the functionality of L2 solutions within the diverse Ethereum ecosystem.
module framework::evm {
    /// Facilitates the execution of a function in an EVM contract from within the current VM environment.
    /// This native function signals the VM to initiate a call to a specified contract in the EVM layer.
    /// It's an integral part of cross-VM communication, enabling interoperability between different blockchain protocols.
    ///
    ///  * `account`: The sender's account, which will be used for authorization and executing the call on the EVM side.
    ///  * `to`: The target EVM contract's address to which the call is directed.
    ///  * `fn_abi`: The ABI signature of the function to be called in the EVM contract, for example, `transfer(address,u256)`.
    ///  * `calldata`: The arguments to be passed to the function. This can be a single primitive type or multiple parameters packed in an object.
    native fun evm<T>(account: &signer, to: address, fn_abi: vector<u8>, calldata: &T);

    /// Enables external entities to initiate a call to an EVM contract.
    ///
    ///  * `account`: The sender's account, which will be used for authorization and executing the call on the EVM side.
    ///  * `to`: The target EVM contract's address to which the call is directed.
    ///  * `fn_abi`: The ABI signature of the function to be called in the EVM contract, for example, `transfer(address,u256)`.
    ///  * `calldata`: The arguments to be passed to the function. This can be a single primitive type or multiple parameters packed in an object.
    public fun call<T>(account: &signer, to: address, fn_abi: vector<u8>, calldata: &T) {
        // ...
        evm(account, to, fn_abi, calldata);
    }
}
```

### EVM

In the EVM part of the genesis block and deployed on the address, similar functionalities are achieved, but with a focus on utilizing events for efficient cross-VM communication.

    ) external {
        emit Call(msg.sender, _moduleAddress, _moduleId, _functionId, _callData, _generics);
    }
}
```

### Concurrency Note&#x20;

Multiple calls can be queued sequentially; however, execution on the target VM commences only after the current runtime completes. This process isn't fully synchronous, but enhancing this aspect is a priority for future updates. Calls are executed in a sequencer, one after another, following the order in which they were initiated.

### Limitations and Gas Pricing

There are inherent limitations in the number of calls and associated gas costs. Specific details on these constraints will be provided after further testing and analysis.
