# Start Building

We currently have several environments available, including one mainnet. Ultimately, all of them will be merged into one Layer 2 (L2) solution. Choose the one you prefer:

* [**Optimism SuperLumio**](<../README (1).md>): the canary mainnet, available on Ethereum, and supports just EVM. It is a pure optimistic rollup based on the Optimism stack.
* [**Testnet**](testnet/): Soon to be replaced with Devnet, this environment combines Move VM and EVM in the same execution environment. It is launched with a modified Reth and Optimism stack.
* [**Devnet**](devnet/): Lumio v2, which supports SVM, EVM, and Move VM. This is the final version of how Lumio will function as described in the current documentation.
