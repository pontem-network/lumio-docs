# Start Building

We currently have several environments available, including one mainnet. Ultimately, all of them will be merged into one Layer 2 (L2) solution.&#x20;

## **Whitelisting**

You can use SuperLumio canary mainnet without whitelisting, while other testnets/devnets (Optimism testnet and Solana devnet)  require [whitelisting](get-whitelisted.md).

Choose the one you prefer:

* [**Optimism SuperLumio**](lumio-on-optimism-canary-mainnet.md): the canary mainnet, available on Ethereum, and supports just EVM. It is a pure optimistic rollup based on the Optimism stack.
* [Optimism Testnet](lumio-on-optimism-testnet/):  the testnet network environment combines Move VM and EVM in the same execution environment. It is launched with a modified Reth and Optimism stack. This one will be replaced with a new architecture once the Solana devnet matures.
* [**Solana Devnet**](lumio-on-solana-devnet/): new architecture (Lumio v2), which supports SVM, EVM, and Move VM. This is the final version of how Lumio will function as described in the current documentation.
