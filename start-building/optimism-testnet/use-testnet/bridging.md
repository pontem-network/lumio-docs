# Bridging

To transfer ETH from the Sepolia Testnet, utilize the bridge portal developed by Pontem. The bridging process typically completes within a few minutes.

To request funds you can use [Sepolia Faucet](https://sepoliafaucet.com) ( or other providers)

As of now, the portal supports bridging of testnet ETH, with the addition of ERC-20 token support anticipated soon.

Please be aware that withdrawals from L2 are currently not functioning. We are actively working on resolving this issue and expect to have it fixed shortly. Thank you for your understanding and patience.

**Important Note:** When bridging ETH, you are transferring it to the EVM. If you need to move it to the Move VM, please await further instructions, which will be provided shortly.

To proceed, visit the [Bridge Portal](https://bridge.lumio.io).
