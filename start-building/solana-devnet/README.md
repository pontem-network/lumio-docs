# Solana Devnet

This is Lumio v2.   The current devnet runs without guarantees: it can be taken down, restarted, or redeployed from scratch. It implements the latest architecture described in the current documentation and supports three VMs: SVM, EVM, and Move VM.

Once the devnet is stable enough, we will replace the current testnet with it and launch it with settlement on Solana.&#x20;

For now, you can connect and explore it on your own.
