# Get Whitelisted

You can use SuperLumio canary mainnet without whitelisting, while other testnets/devnets (Optimism testnet and Solana devnet)  require whitelisting.

## How to get whitelisted?

To get whitelisted, go to our website and use the whitelisting form by clicking the "Join Waitlist" button.&#x20;

## When will I be whitelisted?

We whitelist people in stages, so your turn will come eventually. Being a member of the Pontem Community and using Pontem products can also increase your chances of being whitelisted.
